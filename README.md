### Problem Statement
The AI/NLP TV Series Analysis System addresses the challenge of analyzing TV series content by classifying themes, building character networks, and providing a chatbot for fan interaction. It processes scripts and related materials to identify recurring themes, maps character relationships into dynamic networks, and enables fans to engage with their favorite characters through an interactive chatbot, bridging the gap between storytelling and audience immersion.
